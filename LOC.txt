We were a team of 2 and have done our best to reach the LOC requirements.
We were a team of 3 on paper much of the semester, however we were notified 
that our member dropped right before the semester ended. We also worked as a
team of 2 from the start of the semester. However, tt was hard to adjust
our workload as we were told from our 3rd member that she was ready to fully 
commit. So this last minute decision to drop made us work harder to get to the 
LOC and we hope that our project will be graded with this in mind.

Our .ml and .mli files are in folders "src", "test", "bin".
