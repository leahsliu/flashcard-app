  This project simulates a Quizlet flashcard exercise that allows the user to
  create flashcards and then use them to quiz themselves. One game the user 
  could play could be typing out what they remember for a flashcard until 
  they get it right, with every round having only flashcards that they missed
  in the previous rounds. The user can also add and delete flashcards from their
  deck and create new decks to organize their flashcards.
